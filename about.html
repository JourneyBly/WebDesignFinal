			<h1> About Me</h1>
			<p>
				I learned at a young age that I love vacations. When I was growing up, my family and I would go somewhere every year
				for Christmas. If there is one thing I would do all the time it would be to travel somewhere new
				and meet new people all the time. I would love to help you plan your next vacation or trip. Send
				me an email and let me know what I can help you with. Let’s get that vacation planned!

			<h1>Why to Use Me as a Travel Agent</h1>

			<h2>Experience.</h2> 
			<p>
				I know the market and, if I listen to what you want, I will be able to match
				you with a better product than you can find on the Internet.
			</p>

			<h2>Advocate.</h2>
			<p>
				If something goes wrong on your trip, I will go to bat for you - no matter
				who is at fault - and try to get your vacation back on track.
			</p>

			<h2>Resources.</h2>
			<p>
				I have access to a variety of tools that the average consumer is not able to
				use or doesn't know about. I can sometimes get you a better seat on an airplane, added
				amenities at hotels, room upgrades, event tickets, and plan activities for you.
			</p>

			<h2>Convenience.</h2>
			<p>
				Your time is valuable and you shouldn't have to spend it searching for
				the right vacation. I can do that for you. I can match you with the vacation that you
				actually want, not the one that you saw on television. There is a difference between
				travel inspiration and actual travel desires. Destinations may look good on TV but not
				actually be ideal for you personally. I can help you define what it is you want to get out
				of a vacation.
			</p>

			<h2>Relationships.</h2>
			<p> 
				As you develop a relationship with me, I will be able to target the
				right trips for you without even having a conversation. Ideally, a simple phone call or
				email could result in your next vacation - already planned.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Save Money.</h2>
			<p>
				Often, I can save you money based on our supplier relationships - or
				at least match the price you find - while saving you time and effort.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Added Values.</h2>
			<p>
				There are a lot of value-adds that consumers don't even know about
				that I can add.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Better Destinations.</h2>
			<p>
				I have inside information on the best times to go to crowded
				destinations and I even know what the new "it" destinations are going to be before the
				masses. Want to get there first? Use me as your travel agent.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Exclusive Access.</h2>
			<p>
				Some tours and experiences are only available through a travel
				agent. Many companies offer a lot of components and simply want to make sure a
				customer is right for their experience - exotic tours, treks, private jet products are
				often only available through an agent.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Because We are Awesome.</h2>
			<p>
				Travel agents are some of the most well-rounded,
				funny, personable and knowledgeable people you'll meet. We come from more
				backgrounds than you can even count - we have been professors, hotel owners, tour
				guides, bus drivers. We all have one thing in common: we are passionate about
				sharing the world with you. Take advantage of my services.
